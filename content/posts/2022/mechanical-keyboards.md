This is my first blog post. And I already know I am not too good at writing stuff. But practice will help me improve!<sup>(I hope)</sup>

Also I just started testing out the whole Jamstack / Netlify thing, and I am genuinely impressed! ðŸ¤¯ Might be the subject of the next post!

## Some context

So I dove head first into the mechanical keyboards universe a few weeks ago.  
Being a software engineer I spend a lot of type in front of my keyboard, and believe it or not I sometimes even type on it.

After being curious about keyboard options for a long time I finally crossed the line and ordered a Keychron K3v2 about a month ago.

My choice was fairly sought after <em>at that time</em>, I had been looking at mainly two options: the Nuphy Air75 and the Keychron K3.  
They are both very physically appealing and while this may not be the first thing you look for in a keyboard, I can't say it doesn't weigh in the balance of a newcomer to be honest.

-   Entry-level price ($100 or less)
-   Wireless and easy to connect (Mac & Windows support)
-   Easy to travel with
-   75% format
-   Generally good reviews, again, for an entry-level

I wish I could tell you I was writing this article on the K3 I ordered right now but it turns out buying your first mechanical keyboard may require a bit more research.
have layouts and my non-initiated self forgot to check.

## What defines a keyboard anyway?

Starting with what you can see and interact with first

### Format

-   Full size
-   TKL
-   Compact 75 / 60%
-   ergo
-   40%


### âœ¨ The Keys âœ¨

-   Layout (ANSI / ISO)
-   Disposition (FR-ISO)
-   Keycaps (PBT (backlight))
-   Legends Characters / Novelty (Dye, Lazer, Engraving)
-   Profile (Cherry / OEM)

### âœ¨ The Switches âœ¨

Right underneath the keys, the switches are probably the most talked-about feature of mechanical keyboards.

-   Hot-swappability
-   mechanical / optical / linear
-   click / tactile
-   brands

-   lubricant
-   stabilizers

### âœ¨ The Plate âœ¨

-   disposition / compatibility

### âœ¨ The PCB âœ¨

-   Matrices / Ghosting / N-Key Roll over

### âœ¨ The Case âœ¨

-   Sound

## What comes next?

### Learning to type again

-   typingclub

### Moding

-   moding to improve sound and comfort
-   Changing somes switches (spacebar to a higher activation force?)
