Disclaimers:

This is my first ever blog post! I don't feel soooo confident writing stuff but I hope this will help me improve.

Also, I've had this post in draft forever. I wanted to complete it before posting it but I realized I might just post it and keep it updated instead. <sup><sup>(agile styleðŸ˜Ž)</sup></sup>  

So in the mean time you can check the table of contents to see what subject I plan on addressing.

Final disclaimer: I just started testing out the whole Jamstack / Netlify thing, and I am genuinely impressed! ðŸ¤¯ Might be the subject of the next post!

## Some context

I dove head first into the mechanical keyboards universe a few weeks ago.  
Being a software engineer, I spend a lot of type in front of my keyboard â€” and believe it or not â€” I sometimes even type on it.

After being curious about keyboard options for a long time, I finally crossed the line and ordered a Keychron K3v2 about a month ago. <sub>(So actually a month before I started writing this article for months)</sub>

My choice was fairly sought after <em>at that time</em>, I had been looking at mainly two options: the [Nuphy Air75][nuphy-air75] and the [Keychron K3][keychron-k3v2].  
Both are physically appealing and while this may not be the first thing you should look for in a keyboard, I can't say it doesn't weigh in the balance for a newcomer to be honest.

Here's what I had in mind at the time of purchase:

- Entry-level price ($100 or less);
- Wireless and easy to connect (with Mac & Windows support);
- Easy to travel with (I could use it  at the office or when working remotely at home);
- 75% format is a good size (more on this later);
- Generally good reviews (again, for an entry-level)

I wish I could tell you I was writing this article on the K3 I ordered, but it turns out buying a mechanical keyboard may require a bit more research ðŸ˜….  
If you're looking to buy your first keyboard let me help you by sharing everything I learned!

## What defines a keyboard anyway?

Let's start from a visual perspective

### Format

The keyboard format is one of the very first thing you are going to look at. This decision will impact many things: the number of keys on the board, their disposition, the use of macros, your muscle memory, ...

- **Full size**:  It's your standard keyboard with a numpad and all keys (105 in Europe, 104 US)

- **TKL**: Stands for "ten key less". A fullsize without numpad.  
Main avantage is taking less space on your desk and keeping your mouse closer to you. (more comfortable for gaming)
[][format-tkl-keyboard]

- **Compact**: Anything smaller than a TKL.  
Common formats are 75%, 60% and 40%.

  75% keyboards include the main keys you need on a keyboard to write: letters and symbols, modifiers, as well as F-keys, directional arrows and some specials keys. Even if no standard is established, manufacturers often include "page up"/"down", "home" and "end" keys, "del" and sometimes "ins".
  The most important part with compact keyboards is how many extra keys you get since you will be able to reprogram them to your will using softwares like [VIA][via]
[][format-75-keyboard]

  60% only include the main keys of a keyboard (no F-keys, no arrows, no special keys).  
  Any deleted keys may be accessed using a combination of Fn keys.

  40% are the most minimal keyboard possible. Including only letters, symbols and modifiers. They require users to bind their specific key combination and rely on a lot of muscle memory to make them work.

### âœ¨ The Keys âœ¨

- Layout (ANSI / ISO)
- Disposition (FR-ISO)
- Keycaps (PBT (backlight))
- Legends Characters / Novelty (Dye, Lazer, Engraving)
- Profile (Cherry / OEM)

### âœ¨ The Switches âœ¨

Right underneath the keys, the switches are probably the most talked-about feature of mechanical keyboards.

- Hot-swappability
- mechanical / optical / linear
- click / tactile
- brands

- lubricant
- stabilizers

### âœ¨ The Plate âœ¨

- disposition / compatibility

### âœ¨ The PCB âœ¨

- Matrices / Ghosting / N-Key Roll over

### âœ¨ The Case âœ¨

- Sound

## What comes next?

### Learning to type again

- typingclub

### Moding

- moding to improve sound and comfort
- Changing somes switches (spacebar to a higher activation force?)
