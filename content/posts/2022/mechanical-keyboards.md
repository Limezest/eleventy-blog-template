## Some context on mechanical keyboards

So I dove head first into mechanical keyboards a few weeks ago. (months ago\* as I publish this so lateâ€¦)  
Being a software engineer I spend a lot of type on my keyboard and â€” believe it or not â€” I sometimes even type on it to summon the favors of computer gods.

After being curious about numerous keyboard options for a long time I finally crossed the line and ordered a Keychron K3v2 as my first step in the field.

My choice was fairly sought after <sup>hmm <sup>at <sup>that <sup>time</sup></sup></sup></sup>, I had been looking at mainly two options: the [Nuphy Air75][nuphy-air75] and the [Keychron K3][keychron-k3v2].

Both were physically appealing to me and while this may not be the first thing you _should_ look for in a keyboard, I can't say it doesn't weigh in the balance for a newcomer to be honest.

The main points that interested me in both these keyboards were:

-   Entry-level price ($100 or less);
-   Wireless and easy to connect (with Mac & Windows support);
-   Easy to travel with (I thought about using it at the office or when working remotely at home);
-   75% format is a good size (more on this later);
-   Generally good reviews (again, for an entry-level).

I wish I could tell you I wrote this article on the K3 I ordered but it turns out buying a mechanical keyboard may require a bit more research ðŸ˜….

Let me take you through what I learned in the last few months!

## What's in a keyboard anyway?

Let's start from a visual perspective

### Format

The keyboard format is one of the very first thing you are going to look at. This decision will impact many things: the number of keys on the board, their disposition, the use of macros, your muscle memory, ...

-   **Full size**: It's your standard keyboard with a numpad and all keys (105 in Europe, 104 US)
    [!][format-fullsize-keyboard]
-   **TKL**: Stands for "ten key less". A fullsize without numpad.  
    Main avantage is taking less space on your desk and keeping your mouse closer to you. (more comfortable for gaming)
    [!][format-tkl-keyboard]

-   **Compact**: Anything smaller than a TKL.  
    Common formats are 75%, 60% and 40%.

    75% keyboards include the main keys you need on a keyboard to write: letters and symbols, modifiers, as well as F-keys, directional arrows and some specials keys. Even if no standard is established, manufacturers often include "page up"/"down", "home" and "end" keys, "del" and sometimes "ins".
    The most important part with compact keyboards is how many extra keys you get since you will be able to reprogram them to your will using softwares like [VIA][via]
    [!][format-75-keyboard]

    60% only include the main keys of a keyboard (no F-keys, no arrows, no special keys).  
     Any deleted keys may be accessed using a combination of Fn keys.
    [!][format-60-keyboard]

    40% are the most minimal keyboard possible. Including only letters, symbols and modifiers. They require users to bind their specific key combination and rely on a lot of muscle memory to make them work.

### âœ¨ The Keys âœ¨

-   Layout (ANSI / ISO)
-   Disposition (FR-ISO)
-   Keycaps (PBT (backlight))
-   Legends Characters / Novelty (Dye, Lazer, Engraving)
-   Profile (Cherry / OEM)

### âœ¨ The Switches âœ¨

Right underneath the keys, the switches are probably the most talked-about feature of mechanical keyboards.  
They come in different shapes and feelings.

-   mechanical / optical / linear
-   click / tactile
-   brands

-   3/5-pins / box / housing
-   lubricant
-   stabilizers

-   next-level shit: frankenswitch example

### âœ¨ The Plate âœ¨

-   disposition / compatibility
-   material (pom, pc)

### âœ¨ The PCB âœ¨

-   Hot-swappability / sockets
-   Matrices / Ghosting / N-Key Roll over
-   mounting? (here or in the case chapter)
-   Bluetooth / Cable

### âœ¨ The Case âœ¨

-   Sound
-   mounting? gaskets /socks (here or in the pcb chapter)

## Few advices

Get documented, a lot.  
Many many people can help you online, watch youtube video, follow twitch streams, engage with discord communities.

Good entry-level keyboards cost more than you think. They are probably more around $250 for the cheaper ones.  
If you are really willing to get a suitable custom keyboard, put some money aside for a while and get something around $500 to $600

French azerty layout is a pain in the ass to find.  
Bluetooth is rare but can be found

## What comes next?

### Learn to type again

It took me a lot of time to get my typing speed and accuracy back from a membrane keyboard to a mechanical one, especially with a tall profile and light actuation switches.  
I can only recommend so much [Typing Club][typing-club] to help you with touch typing.

## Moding

-   moding to improve sound and comfort
-   Changing somes switches (spacebar to a higher activation force?)
