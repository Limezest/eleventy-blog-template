## Some context on mechanical keyboards

So I dove head first into mechanical keyboards a few weeks ago. (months ago\* as I publish this so lateâ€¦)  
Being a software engineer I spend a lot of type on my keyboard, and believe it or not I sometimes even type on it to summon the favors of computer gods.

After being curious about numerous keyboard options for a long time I finally crossed the line and ordered a Keychron K3v2 as my first step in the field.

My choice was fairly sought after <em>hmm at that time</em>, I had been looking at mainly two options: the Nuphy Air75 and the Keychron K3.  
They are both very physically appealing and while this may not be the first thing you look for in a keyboard, I can't say it doesn't weigh in the balance of a newcomer to be honest.

The main points that interested me in both these keyboards were:

-   Entry-level price ($100 or less)
-   Wireless and easy to connect (Mac & Windows support)
-   Easy to travel with
-   75% format
-   Generally good reviews, again, for an entry-level

I wish I could tell you I wrote this article on the K3 I ordered but it turns out buying a mechanical keyboard may require a bit more research.

Let me take you through what I learned in the last few months.

## What defines a keyboard anyway?

Starting with what you can primarily see and interact with first:

### âœ¨ The Keys âœ¨

-   Layout (ANSI / ISO)
-   Disposition (FR-ISO)
-   Keycaps (PBT (backlight))
-   Characters / Novelty (Dye)
-   Profile (Cherry / OEM)

### âœ¨ The Switches âœ¨

Right underneath the keys, the switches are probably the most talked-about feature of mechanical keyboards.  
They come in different shapes and feelings.

-   mechanical / optical / linear
-   click / tactile
-   brands

-   3/5-pins / box / housing
-   lubricant
-   stabilizers

-   next-level shit: frankenswitch example

### âœ¨ The Plate âœ¨

-   disposition / compatibility
-   material (pom, pc)

### âœ¨ The PCB âœ¨

-   Hot-swappability / sockets
-   Matrices / Ghosting / N-Key Roll over
-   mounting? (here or in the case chapter)
-   Bluetooth / Cable

### âœ¨ The Case âœ¨

-   Sound
-   mounting? gaskets /socks (here or in the pcb chapter)

## Few advices

Get documented, a lot.  
Many many people can help you online, watch youtube video, follow twitch streams, engage with discord communities.

Good entry-level keyboards cost more than you think. They are probably more around $250 for the cheaper ones.  
If you are really willing to get a suitable custom keyboard, put some money aside for a while and get something around $500 to $600

French azerty layout is a pain in the ass to find.  
Bluetooth is rare but can be found

## What comes next?

### Learn to type again

It took me a lot of time to get my typing speed and accuracy back from a membrane keyboard to a mechanical one, especially with a tall profile and light actuation switches.  
I can only recommend so much [Typing Club][typing-club] to help you with touch typing.
